## How would you describe _Redux Zero_ to someone who has never heard of it?

Redux Zero is a simple way to handle state in modern applications. It's lightweight, easy to learn and already works with React, React Native, Preact and Svelte, and we have plans to add Angular and Vue.js bindings as well.

## How does *Redux Zero* work?

It's very simple.

First, we need to create your store. This is where your application state will live:

With Redux Zero you just have a store:

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux-zero';

const initialState = { count: 1 };
const store = createStore(initialState);

export default store;
```

Then, create your actions. This is where you change the state from your store:

```javascript
const actions = store => ({
  increment: state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }),
  decrement: state => ({ count: state.count - 1 })
});
```

By the way, because the actions are bound to the store, they are just pure functions :)

Now create your component. With Redux Zero your component can focus 100% on the UI and just call the actions that will automatically update the state:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'redux-zero/react';

import actions from './actions';

const mapToProps = ({ count }) => ({ count });

export default connect(mapToProps, actions)(({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{count}</h1>
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>decrement</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>increment</button>
    </div>
  </div>
));
```

Last but not least, plug the whole thing in your index file:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "redux-zero/react";

import store from "./store";

import Counter from "./Counter";

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>
);

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## How does *Redux Zero* differ from other solutions?

Redux is great, but in some cases, it's way too much. Maybe you donâ€™t want to add all of that boilerplate to your project. Or maybe the learning curve is too steep and you just want something simpler to work with.

Redux Zero, on the other hand, is very simple. You don't have to learn about dispatchers and reducers (that's why the name is Redux Zero by the way because there are zero reducers).

With Redux Zero you just have a store and some actions.

## Why did you develop *Redux Zero*?

One of our developers here at [Concrete](https://concrete.com.br/), [Miguel Albernaz](https://twitter.com/miguel_albernaz), was using this [gist](https://gist.github.com/developit/55c48d294abab13a146eac236bae3219) instead of Redux as a state management tool. The project was going so well, that I decided to extract the code, modify it a little bit and open source it to the community.

What I did not expect was this huge success in less than a month.

## What next?

Right now we have three things in mind:
- Improve the documentation
- Add a middleware
- Add Angular and Vue.js bindings (if you're reading this, [we need your help](https://github.com/concretesolutions/redux-zero/issues)).

## What does the future look like for *Redux Zero* and web development in general? Can you see any particular trends?

This is a really hard question. Everything is moving so fast in web development that's really hard to make predictions. With that said I think that web components and state management tools are here to stay.

## What advice would you give to programmers getting into web development?

Study the basics. React and Angular are probably going to die, but JavaScript and CSS won't.

## Who should I interview next?

[Jason Miller](https://twitter.com/_developit)

## Any last remarks?

Try to be kind to open source maintainers. Most of them are not getting paid to develop the tools that you're using for free.

## Conclusion

Thanks for the interview Matheus!

<p>As building tools such as this isn&apos;t easy, I&apos;m primarily curious to know why Ray picked React and what sort of challenges he faced during the development of his service.</p>

The front-end ecosystem is constantly morphing, so we have to stay on top of front-end news. That&apos;s how I heard about React, most likely from Hacker News. The path to Webpack was natural from there. Many example projects use Webpack and there&apos;s a lot of Webpack and React development overlap in the community.

<p>I built ShaderFrog to solve a problem that no one was aware existed. I was making a WebGL 3d browser game, where your character is a bubble in an underwater environment. To make a <a href="http://shaderfrog.com/app/view/147">bubble look convincing visually</a> you have to have a few effects, such as reflection and refraction. The program that draws these effects is called a &quot;shader.&quot;</p>
<p>It tells the computer how to &quot;shade&quot; a 3d object. I also had a <a href="http://shaderfrog.com/app/view/30">fireball powerup</a>, and I wanted to show the player getting the powerup by combining the fire effect (a shader) and the bubble effect (another shader).</p>
<p>That meant I had to take these two programs and combine them together by hand, and essentially add their output color together. It was quite tedious, and I thought I could build a tool to automate the process. That&apos;s how ShaderFrog was born.</p>
<p>ShaderFrog is a tool to design effects called shaders for 3d games and applications in a visual environment without writing code. There are still plenty of features to add, and it&apos;s still finding its place in the world. Right now I&apos;m continuing to build out more features and doing some marketing.</p>

<p>As a front-end developer for most of my career, React feels like the first framework that got it &quot;right.&quot; I had previously tried Angular and Backbone, and toyed with Ember, but none of them felt like they actually helped me solve complex UI problems.</p>
<p>One of React&apos;s biggest benefits is it stays as close to normal Javascript paradigms as possible. You don&apos;t have to understand <code>$scope</code> or learn a huge API like Backbone. It&apos;s just functions and Javascript classes. Even JSX is just HTML and Javascript.</p>
<p>Learning Flux was a steep hill for me, but in the end you&apos;re basically writing event listeners and plain Javascript objects. Server side rendering was very important to me too. I honestly feel like without React, I could not have built ShaderFrog.</p>

What would you do differently?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-sort-of-challenges-did-you-encounter-during-development-what-would-you-do-differently-">#</a></h2>
<p>React is a newcomer to the field and we&apos;re still figuring out how to do things correctly. CSS is the easiest target. React is teaching me that CSS is a fundamentally flawed concept and that our newest iteration of inline styles, or <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS Modules</a>, is a welcomed future. There is plenty of legacy CSS in ShaderFrog that I am embarrassed by, but at least I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>I faced some challenges specific to making a 3d editor. I need to maintaining 60 frames per second constantly. For example, let&apos;s say I have three lights moving around my scene. Every time their position changes, I have to fire an action through Flux, which triggers many component updates.</p>
<p>If you do this three times per <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, you get two unnecessary virtual DOM comparison checks. The solution to this problem was to &quot;batch&quot; the Flux calls until the last one, so my stores only emit once per loop, removing unnecessary work.</p>
<p>When I first started work on ShaderFrog, I didn&apos;t fully understand Flux, so I built a few things using event listeners binding to specific data properties. This code is still in my application, and it&apos;s often a source of bugs, and more difficult to reason about than the Flux code. If I could change things I would have stuck more closely to the Flux pattern, because every time I diverge, it causes me problems and increased cognitive load.</p>
<p>Server side rendering was also a big challenge. React has an unspoken idea that you get server side rendering for free, but this is very far from the truth. For static pages, yes, it&apos;s easy to render some components to an HTML string. For dynamic pages that require data pre-fetching that must be done differently on the client and the server, there are countless edge cases. I hope that in the future, Relay solves many of these problems.</p>

Can you see any particular trends?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-">#</a></h2>
<p>React has paved a bright future of front-end development, but React probably isn&apos;t the end of the road. A better virtual DOM library may come out. We&apos;ve already seen the evolution of the Flux pattern with Redux, and the evolution of CSS with inline and CSS modules. I would definitely say we&apos;re moving towards more computer science principles boosting the productivity of the front-end.</p>
<p>We&apos;re moving towards more componentization, less coupling, and more portability. React has shown many front-end developers the true power of an entirely self contained component. I think these principles will continue to drive the productivity and enjoyment of front-end development forward.</p>

<p>Thanks for the interview Andrew! I wish you great success with <a href="http://shaderfrog.com/">ShaderFrog</a>.</p>
<p>I remember writing little shaders of my own in the past. If you&apos;ve ever wondered what to use math for, well, here&apos;s a good application. You can actually put operations, such as <code>mod</code>, into use here! It&apos;s amazing how little operations can make nice patterns.</p>
<p>To get started, <a href="http://shaderfrog.com/app">pick up a shader</a> you like and start modifying. If you want to dig into theory, you can&apos;t go wrong with NeHe&apos;s material. They&apos;ve written <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/article/glsl_an_introduction/25007/">an introduction to GLSL</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your shaders at the comments.</p>

Now I&apos;m going to give you release notes for both <code>v1.6</code> and <code>v1.7</code> at once. I have also some news of the future plans. So stay tuned.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-model-changes" id="development-model-changes"></a><span class="text">Development Model Changes</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#development-model-changes">#</a></h2>
<p>I&apos;ve moved to a staged development model. Now I maintain <code>master</code> and <code>dev</code> branches. <code>master</code> contains the current stable release. All development happens at <code>dev</code>. This way the code examples stay in sync with the book and the site. Less frustration and a better book for everyone. If you have PRs in mind, please make them against <code>dev</code>.</p>

<p>In total 63 commits went to <code>v1.6</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some typo fixes were made. A lot more follow in <code>v1.7</code>.</li>
<li><code>webpack-dev-server</code> configuration was pushed to <code>webpack.config.js</code></li>
<li>Noted that <code>webpack.config.babel.js</code> works. I&apos;ve expanded on this at <code>v1.7</code></li>
<li>A lot of effort went into making <em>Implementing a Basic Note Application</em> easier to approach</li>
<li>Dropped custom <code>findIndex</code>. In <code>v1.7</code> I went further and now it uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/array.prototype.findindex">array.prototype.findindex</a></li>
<li>Added imagery to <em>React and Flux</em></li>
<li>Mentioned that <code>-S</code> and <code>-D</code> map to <code>npm i --save</code> and <code>npm i --save-dev</code>. This is just for you keyboard jockeys out there.</li>
<li>Added the book subtitle to the cover. It looked strange without.</li>
<li>Formatted all <code>npm i</code> parts so that they stand out better. The web version uses special formatting reminiscent of a real terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0">all changes</a>.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#book-improvements-v1-7-" id="book-improvements-v1-7-"></a><span class="text">Book Improvements - <code>v1.7</code></span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#book-improvements-v1-7-">#</a></h2>
<p>108 commits went to <code>v1.7</code>. So based on numbers it was busier. Especially the early part of the week was good. After that it was all berries and mushrooms for me. It&apos;s the season after all and Winter is coming.</p>
<ul>
<li>A massive amount of typo and grammar fixes were made in this iteration. I tried my luck with Fiverr and it paid off seriously. Thank you Ava and Nancy! There might be some left still but we squashed quite a few. I also ran the content through <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> to simplify sentence structures where needed.</li>
<li>I managed to make <em>webpack.config.js</em> <code>TARGET</code> selection cross-platform. Now the configuration relies on <code>process.env.npm_lifecycle_event</code>. npm sets that during execution and we can rely on that. Thanks Hector for pointing me to the right direction!</li>
<li>Clarified point about <code>eval</code>. As it happens Webpack provides multiple <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool">devtool</a> options. I suggest <code>eval-source-map</code> for development in small projects. You can try faster, lower quality options with bigger projects.</li>
<li>Noted that it&apos;s possible to exit Node.js repl using <code>CTRL-D</code> instead of <code>CTRL-C</code>. Thanks to Ahmed for pointing this out!</li>
<li>Improved Kanban project naming (consistent with CRUD) overall. Now it should read a little better. I also pushed reference related logic to a store method. It&apos;s nicer but still a lot of code considering what it actually does. As long as we operate through indices like this, there&apos;s no neat way around it.</li>
<li>Showed how to set up isomorphic rendering for the Kanban application. It&apos;s not that useful in this case. I do hope you get the idea as it&apos;s powerful.</li>
<li>Dropped deployment chapter. As I managed to explain isomorphic rendering earlier in the previous point, the deployment chapter became redundant. Good riddance.</li>
<li>Added JSX suffixes to imports. As the project gets run through Node.js context when rendering in an isomorphic way, I had to add JSX suffixes. Perhaps someone knows a better solution but this made sense at the time.</li>
<li>Pushed id creation inside stores. The reasoning for this is that if you are dealing with a real back-end, that&apos;s the way it goes. You should <em>never</em> have to think about ids at view level so it&apos;s better to do it right. Besides now gluing a real back-end with the project is a notch easier.</li>
<li>Reworked the early part of the Flux chapter with my editor (thanks Jes&#xFA;s!). The chapter can likely still be improved but it&apos;s better now. It&apos;s a little long to my tastes but on the other hand it covers a lot of ground.</li>
<li>Ended up using term <em>Webpack</em> everywhere. I know <em>webpack</em> is the correct name but I went for consistency here. So consider that &quot;Webpack&quot; == &quot;webpack&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to get some screenshots done for this iteration too and work on a Leanpub exclusive chapter. This work will go to the next iteration. The good news are that now there&apos;s far less to worry about so I&apos;m more likely to get these tasks done.</p>

<p>Fail to plan, plan to fail.</p>

<p>It seems to me the book is on a good track and we&apos;re making steady progress. New people are finding the book and even buying it. And the feedback has been good. I know the book isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s piece of cake. But I&apos;m okay with that. By trying to please everyone you please none.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#going-amazon" id="going-amazon"></a><span class="text">Going Amazon</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#going-amazon">#</a></h3>
<p>The next major goal for me is to get the book to Amazon, iBooks and such through <a href="https://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a>. This might also provide us a paper version if there&apos;s demand. Enhanced distribution could go a long way in improving sales. After all I&apos;ll need to make this work financially in order to be able to write more.</p>
<p>For this to happen we&apos;ll need to lock the scope of the book. This is due to ISBN requirements. You can make small changes to a published book but nowhere on the level what we&apos;re doing right now.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover" id="but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover"></a><span class="text">But There&apos;s More Technology to Cover</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover">#</a></h3>
<p>I know interesting new technology, such as <a href="https://github.com/rackt/redux">redux</a>, keeps on coming out all the time. The problem is that if I keep on changing the newest cool thing I will never get a stable version out. It is far better idea to lock the scope and cover the interesting things through the blog.</p>
<p>This gives me a more flexible way to try out various ideas before committing them to a book. It also helps to give the current work some visibility it sorely needs.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-current-plan" id="the-current-plan"></a><span class="text">The Current Plan</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#the-current-plan">#</a></h3>
<p>As a result the current plan is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue iterating on the current content based on feedback. No major changes to the chapter structure anymore, just minor tweaks to make the book more approachable.</li>
<li>Write chapters that are unique for the commercial edition. This improves the value proposition and actually might encourage more people to buy the book. After all, that enables more content! I expect at least three chapters.</li>
<li>Expand this blog with supporting topics. I have a nice series of posts planned up and I welcome ideas. I want more people to discover the book and this could go a long way towards that.</li>
<li>Figure out how Hacker News works. I did try <em>Show HN</em> but received zero response. Perhaps I&apos;ll have better luck next time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a><span class="text">Conclusion</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>So towards the Amazon release I go. It might be interesting to try running some sort of campaign to eventually open the unique content. For now I will need to let the commercial version to have some leverage over the community edition. Perhaps there&apos;s a way to align these two goals (community content, making a living) but as for now this might be the way.</p>
<p>I will be able to tell a lot more after a wider scale release. Given I&apos;m a first time author I&apos;m still learning the ropes here and no doubt making a lot of mistakes in the process. I have other book ideas but I&apos;ll have to get this first one out before I can even think about those. Perhaps within a year or so I can do an expanded second edition. Any sooner and I&apos;m pissing off my first edition readers. :)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this release. As usual <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues">feedback</a> and pull requests are welcome. It&apos;s interesting to write a book this way. That&apos;s for sure.</p>
<p>Remember that you can support my work by <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react">purchasing the book at Leanpub</a>. Every little bit counts and allows me to keep it up.</p>

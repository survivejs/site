I&#39;ve taken that into account in this release. I have a date for the final in sight and I won&#39;t be making any significant changes for the final release.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not going to be the perfect book in any way, but it&#39;s absolutely far better book than I could have pulled off on my own. Given this is my first effort, it has been a great learning experience. And it continues to be so.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overview-of-the-situation" id="overview-of-the-situation"></a><span class="text">Overview of the Situation</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#overview-of-the-situation">#</a></h2>
<p>I split my efforts during the past two weeks towards a couple of separate goals. My primary goal was to smooth out remaining bigger issues. <a href="https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack_react">The book chat</a> helped a lot in this regard. I also enjoy discussing with my readers through mail. It&#39;s great to get multiple perspectives on the content.</p>
<p>My secondary goals included getting some coding done and preparing for a little presentation I have promised to give. I don&#39;t normally get invited to talk so I like to get the most out of these special occasions.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#work-on-react-components" id="work-on-react-components"></a><span class="text">Work on React Components</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#work-on-react-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Since you need to be able to practice what you preach, I did a little API design experiment in form of <a href="https://bebraw.github.io/react-pagify/">react-pagify</a>. It is a paginator component for React. I know it sounds like a trivial one, but the goal here was to end up with something flexible while providing a minimal API surface. This was achieved partially through utilizing <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html">React context</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been considering using a similar design for <a href="http://reactabular.js.org/">reactabular</a>, a data table component of mine. This was a good chance to experiment with the ideas in smaller scale. I think the design will fit <em>reactabular</em> well and allow me to improve its API further without sacrificing any functionality.</p>

<p>Beyond component development I put thought towards a presentation I have to give at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/frontendfinland/events/228369937/">February Meetup of Frontend Finland</a>. Given I rather write than talk, this gave me a good excuse to write an opinion piece. I believe there&#39;s room for <a href="./towards-common-components">a common component definition</a>. Something like this would allow us to make the ecosystem stronger and more vibrant.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#improving-kanban" id="improving-kanban"></a><span class="text">Improving Kanban</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#improving-kanban">#</a></h3>
<p>The Kanban implementation has improved a notch. It won&#39;t allow you to drag an input that&#39;s being edited anymore. I also found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33108567/webpack-hash-the-same-for-css-and-js-files-both-change-when-only-one-should">a book related question</a> at Stack Overflow. The problem had to do with hashing and cache invalidation.</p>
<p>If CSS was altered in the current, it also changed the hash of JavaScript. This is definitely something you don&#39;t want to happen. It took a while to understand what&#39;s going on, but then it hit me. Given we were using <code>require</code> to bring the CSS to JavaScript, this made it end up in the same chunk. And that&#39;s the core of the issue here.</p>
<p>I realized the only good way to resolve this issue was to separate the CSS into a chunk of its own. This change has been implemented in the book now. The Kanban CSS gets loaded through an <em>entry chunk</em> of its own. The only gotcha with this approach is that it will generate a redundant JavaScript. It&#39;s annoying but something you can live with. To keep track of the problem, I <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1967">opened an issue</a>.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introducing-npm-install-webpack-plugin-" id="introducing-npm-install-webpack-plugin-"></a><span class="text">Introducing <em>npm-install-webpack-plugin</em></span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#introducing-npm-install-webpack-plugin-">#</a></h3>
<p>One of my personal annoyances with the book has been all those <code>npm install</code> parts. Often they just break the flow as you have to jump into terminal and do some work there. Fortunately there&#39;s a good solution for this problem now.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ericclemmons/npm-install-webpack-plugin">npm-install-webpack-plugin</a> by Eric Clemmons is able to detect when you <code>require</code> something in your project and install the dependency in question. It&#39;s not completely perfect yet as it doesn&#39;t allow us to choose between <code>--save</code> and <code>--save-dev</code> easily based on context yet. I&#39;ve discussed about this with Eric and it&#39;s likely a feature that will be developed in the near future. I wrote a little proof of concept and it worked somewhat nicely.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always fun to discover small gems like this plugin. You can still install all your dependencies by hand of course, but at least now there&#39;s a good option that can save some trouble.</p>

<p>In total 68 commits went to <code>2.0.0-rc4</code>. To make it easier to follow what happened and where, I&#39;ve split up the changes below.</p>
<p>See GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v2.0.0-rc3...v2.0.0-rc4">all changes</a>. Especially the &quot;Files changed&quot; tab is highly useful.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a><span class="text">Introduction</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#introduction">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clarified the book repository structure and mentioned the repository defaults to <code>dev</code>. That&#39;s not likely the branch you want to see so there&#39;s an image showing how to find the one you are after.</li>
<li>Linked to <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/ama/issues">SurviveJS AmA</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added an example of output you might get when running Webpack the first time.</li>
<li>Moved to use object format for <code>entry</code>. This leads to less hassle later on when dealing with styling and hashing so this felt like a good move.</li>
<li>Dropped redundant <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> mention.</li>
<li>Explained <code>0.0.0.0</code> idea earlier on so you might actually find it in case you are using a virtual machine.</li>
<li>Explained <code>eval</code> options in greater detail. Now it&#39;s clearer that options starting with <code>eval-</code> emit sourcemaps as a part of JavaScript code. Better performance, but obviously this is a bad idea for production usage as it bloats the bundle.</li>
<li>Integrated <em>npm-install-webpack-plugin</em> so that plenty of those <code>npm install</code> bits could be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#webpack-and-react" id="webpack-and-react"></a><span class="text">Webpack and React</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#webpack-and-react">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Put emphasis on the fact why <code>include</code> is used at the loader definition. I strongly recommend using it just for the sake of improved performance. This also documents how you expect Webpack to parse your project.</li>
<li>Added a tip showing how to use brace expansion with npm. Example: <code>npm i babel-preset-{es2015,react} -D</code>.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-array-includes">babel-plugin-array-includes</a> to SurviveJS preset. Given <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes">array.includes</a> is a part of the standard now, this felt like a good chance to begin using it over <code>indexOf</code> in certain places.</li>
<li>Mentioned alternatives to shimming <code>Object.assign</code> through Babel.</li>
<li>Explained how to develop your own Babel presets.</li>
<li>Mentioned that React developer tools won&#39;t work if you are using Webpack in the iframe mode.</li>
<li>Mentioned <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-require">babel-plugin-react-require</a> as an alternative to including <code>React</code> for function based components.</li>
<li>Improved flow around the part where HMR is set up with React. Now the content is discussed in a more approachable order.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Simplified <strong>Generating Ids</strong> section. It&#39;s the same content, but in simpler form.</li>
<li>Mentioned <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/autobind-decorator">autobind-decorator</a>. That&#39;s an interesting looking alternative at least.</li>
<li>Explained the <code>ref</code> idea in greater detail.</li>
<li>Explained how <code>Note</code> state changes are communicated in greater detail.</li>
<li>Discussed the problem of <code>state</code>. This is something you need to think a lot in the context of React.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#react-and-flux" id="react-and-flux"></a><span class="text">React and Flux</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#react-and-flux">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Explained <code>Object.assign</code>. Given it&#39;s not that common yet, it felt like a good idea to explain why and how it is used here.</li>
<li>Simplified code examples so that they are easier to copy from Markdown. That&#39;s how I like to read the book by the way.</li>
<li>Used <code>includes</code> over <code>indexOf</code> where it made sense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#from-notes-to-kanban" id="from-notes-to-kanban"></a><span class="text">From Notes to Kanban</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#from-notes-to-kanban">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dropped <code>constructor</code> from <code>Lane</code>. Even though binding the lane id to methods worked this way, it&#39;s often an anti-pattern to map a prop this way. This is true particularly if the value of a prop can change. It binds through property initializers now.</li>
<li>Added <code>stopPropagation</code> to <code>deleteNote</code> to avoid issues with hovering.</li>
<li>Mentioned that <code>Editable</code> uses <strong>uncontrolled</strong> design and discussed <strong>controlled</strong> alternative.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-drag-and-drop" id="implementing-drag-and-drop"></a><span class="text">Implementing Drag and Drop</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#implementing-drag-and-drop">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplified logic by introducing <code>includes</code> to code.</li>
<li>Fixed editing behavior during dragging. This means an additional check needed to add to <code>Note</code> so that we know to enable/disable dragging based on editing state. This is a good example of the importance of state management.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#building-kanban" id="building-kanban"></a><span class="text">Building Kanban</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#building-kanban">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplified <code>DefinePlugin</code> declaration to form <code>&#39;process.env.NODE_ENV&#39;: &#39;&quot;production&quot;&#39;</code>. <code>JSON.stringify</code> felt a little too verbose and it didn&#39;t communicate the idea as well.</li>
<li>Added a checklist of <code>dependencies</code> you should see before starting to split your bundles.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>Clean</code> to <code>CleanPlugin</code> in the sake of consistency. Other plugins have <code>Plugin</code> suffix so this one should have one too.</li>
<li>Dropped the mention of <code>autoprefixer-loader</code> given it has been deprecated. Use <code>postcss-loader</code> instead.</li>
<li>Explained how to improve caching behavior by loading CSS through an entry chunk. This won&#39;t work for each and every case, but it felt like a decent solution here as it fixes hashing. That was the main goal here after all.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#testing-react-" id="testing-react-"></a><span class="text">Testing React*</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#testing-react-">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved from <em>phantomjs</em> to <em>phantomjs-prebuilt</em> as the package was renamed.</li>
<li>Mentioned <a href="https://jsverify.github.io/">JSVerify</a>, a property testing tool.</li>
<li>Mentioned <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/invariant">invariant</a> package.</li>

<p>Content-wise I&#39;m done. I am still willing to do minor tweaks based on your feedback, but major work has to wait for the next releases. I can&#39;t wait to get back to a normal release cycle.</p>
<p>I will have to proof the content. In other words, I will have to go through it very carefully a couple of times and try to catch any remaining issues. No doubt some will remain, but that&#39;s how books work. I will also have to craft a cover for the paper version and figure out what to put on the backside and spine. If nothing else, at least I&#39;ll get something to put on my bookshelf out of this!</p>

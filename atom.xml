I rather get something to work fast than agonize on details. It is going to take a fair amount of iteration no matter what. This site is a good example of scrappy design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-scrappy&quot;&gt;Getting Scrappy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started from a base design created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://eldh.co/&quot;&gt;Andreas Eldh&lt;/a&gt;. We have developed a static site generator known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://antwarjs.github.io/&quot;&gt;Antwar&lt;/a&gt; together. Incidentally it is based upon webpack and React. And Antwar itself is based on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://braddenver.com/blog/2015/react-static-site.html&quot;&gt;experiment by Brad Denver&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling scrappy yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nothing is harder than evaluating your own work I looked actively for feedback during the development process. I had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://antwarjs.github.io/blog/antwar-050/&quot;&gt;develop Antwar further&lt;/a&gt; in order to reach my goals. Besides the technical part I also had to make sure the content is accessible and that there&amp;apos;s marketing copy in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is scrappy in sense that I integrated ideas from various sources. Sometimes I might realize something randomly and will just add it there. A good example is the recent addition of commenting per chapter. I understood it might be a nice way to get some extra feedback on content and help me to see potential problems clearer. And given it was fast to add, it made perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;services-to-support-scrappy-design&quot;&gt;Services to Support Scrappy Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides asking for feedback from friends and sometimes total strangers I used a couple of services with varying results. Out of the services &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticue.com/&quot;&gt;criticue&lt;/a&gt; worked the best for me. Often it&amp;apos;s the negative feedback that helps you the most. Criticue helped me to prune out the worst mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had good experiences of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbackroulette.com/&quot;&gt;Feedback roulette&lt;/a&gt; in the past I set it up too. Unfortunately I have yet to receive single useful round of feedback even though I have a single credit for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fivesecondtest.com/&quot;&gt;Five Second Test&lt;/a&gt; was useful for getting answers to specific design issues. I didn&amp;apos;t use it a lot, though, but I can see its value. The response times were adequate as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these services allow you to earn credits by providing feedback yourself. Even though this takes time it can be enlightening to see designs of other people and help them to improve. Perhaps over longer term you might develop a stronger intuition for design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the current design of the site is quite passable. It doesn&amp;apos;t remind me of the 90s too much at least. I&amp;apos;m sure it could be better in some ways but as they say you are blind to your own work. I have outlined some issues I&amp;apos;m aware of at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/site/issues&quot;&gt;site issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any ideas, please set up issues there for me to study or comment on this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to have more functionality on the site. Even though Disqus comments work I believe Medium style commenting system would work better for books. Unfortunately I haven&amp;apos;t been able to find a suitable 3rd party service for this purpose yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have more interactivity. Web as a platform would allow that but of course it&amp;apos;s going to require a lot of work to pull off. That said if you are aiming for the maximum amount of awesomeness, go interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-could-have-been-done-differently-&quot;&gt;What Could Have Been Done Differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have probably saved a great deal of time by going with some established solution such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; supports Jekyll particularly well and I have even written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeswejekyll.com/&quot;&gt;scrappy guide for it&lt;/a&gt; so I know the topic. I&amp;apos;m also aware of the limitations of Jekyll. Developing Antwar gave me a good excuse to learn more about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole site design could have been bought from elsewhere. Same goes for marketing copy, photography and such. In fact this given me a good excuse to work on these skills. That said it may be a good idea to use professional services in the future. After all they have spent years honing their skills and will be able to get better results faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this brief post gave you some idea of why the site is the way it is. If you like the design or just want to study how it has been made, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/site&quot;&gt;site repository&lt;/a&gt;. The source itself might be a little scrappy in parts but that&amp;apos;s to be expected. It&amp;apos;s a scrappy design after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the nicest thing about working on a webpack and React stack is that it gives me a nice amount of flexibility. I can build layouts using React and author using Markdown. That&amp;apos;s the best out of both worlds. Antwar is still missing some of the functionality you might expect (pagination, tagging etc.) but it keeps on growing as I use it. No need to aim for perfection the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel web design is scrappy by definition. It is hard to get everything right the first time around. It is a good idea to leave room for creativity and experimentation. I suppose taken further you would start running tests on your site and looking at the numbers. So far my approach has been guided by intuition and might not be the best when compared to data based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry ><title >Reaching Towards the Next Level</title><id >areachingtowardsthenextlevel2015-07-15t00:00:00+03:00</id><link href="http://survivejs.com/blog/reaching-towards-the-next-level"></link><updated >2015-07-15T00:00:00+03:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;./balance&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; I discussed some of the difficulties of related to technical publishing. I also presented a possible solution, a mixed model that might make open publishing more feasible. The idea is that starting closed and asking for money beforehand you reward early adopters while decreasing the risk of the author. As the content gets opened eventually others can benefit from it. I know this goes against the common wisdoms of book publishing but it&amp;apos;s a model I would like to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become apparent to me that if I put my weight behind it, I could grow this into a business that&amp;apos;s able to support me and perhaps a few others should I get so lucky. Even though Finland has its issues it isn&amp;apos;t a bad place to start a company. In fact there&amp;apos;s support for starting businesses that can help to cover starting costs up to 18 months. It will be enough to get past the beginning stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-a-viable-business-look-like-&quot;&gt;What Would a Viable Business Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get by I would have to make around $1500 per month after taxes. That&amp;apos;s $50 per day. In terms of book sales that would mean five sales per day assuming a book costs $20 (half goes to side costs). It doesn&amp;apos;t sound so hard when put this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately book sales aren&amp;apos;t the only towards a sustainable business. More specialized products can be built on top of the freely available content. In addition I&amp;apos;m open to consulting. In the end it comes down to finding the ways in which I can be most useful and provide most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-about-helping-other-developers&quot;&gt;It&amp;apos;s About Helping Other Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer myself I have known my share of pain. SurviveJS is about that. I want you to avoid some of that pain. If I can make someone&amp;apos;s life a little easier through SurviveJS I have done my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides helping developers I would love to be able to help smoothen the way for other technical authors. Getting started is tough and anything you can do to make it less so is welcome. Leanpub helps in its own way but it isn&amp;apos;t nearly enough. There are just so many things to worry about. And should you fail at some critical aspect, you end up with a dud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next major goal is to resolve the biggest remaining issues related to the book and get a release out on 31st. After that I&amp;apos;ll expand distribution to see if that makes any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of older books in backburner waiting to be edited. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/&quot;&gt;Webpack and React Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. It deserves a refresh and an editing pass. As the content is already freely available that won&amp;apos;t change. Ebook will cost, though, and will hopefully provide some financial relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, older effort known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/js_tricks_and_tips&quot;&gt;JavaScript Tips and Tricks&lt;/a&gt;, will require a bigger refresh. It&amp;apos;s actually the original &amp;quot;SurviveJS&amp;quot; and the reason why I ended up with the name. The idea of this book is to go through a variety of JavaScript techniques to give you deeper insight to the language. It won&amp;apos;t be a long book. It&amp;apos;s more of a &amp;quot;oh, I can do that?&amp;quot; type of an affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over shorter term I want to establish little streams like these. After all every dollar counts at this point. The sooner I can reach my viability goal, the better. Over longer term I would love to grow the brand to help other technical authors. But before I can do that I need to help myself and figure out these things. Fortunately I won&amp;apos;t have to do that alone as community support has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming incorporated is both an exciting and a scary step. So far community response has been great so why not to push it and see if this can be turned into a real business? The numbers look realistic to me. In the worst case it won&amp;apos;t work out and I end up with a ton of references to use at a job interview. In the best case I&amp;apos;ll have a little business that will allow me to produce even more content and most importantly keep on helping.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry ><title >Balancing Between Open and Closed Publishing</title><id >abalancingbetweenopenandclosedpublishing2015-07-14t00:00:00+03:00</id><link href="http://survivejs.com/blog/balance"></link><updated >2015-07-14T00:00:00+03:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;apos;s one thing technical authors have in common, it&amp;apos;s that they all want to help other people. The question is how to achieve that most effectively. In my &lt;a href=&quot;./the-story-so-far&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I discussed how I have fared with my first effort so far. The results have been mixed. Community response has been amazing in many ways but that hasn&amp;apos;t translated to amazing sales. That said I&amp;apos;m grateful to all that have contributed. In the end sales enable further efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was likely naive in thinking that having the content freely available while offering a way to purchase a digital copy would work by default. The greatest benefit of this approach has been possible extra visibility (easy to link) and the amount of external contributions. I believe this has improved the quality of the book further than I could have ever achieved alone. Next time around I might have a group of people that are interested in pushing the content straight from the start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-publishing-solutions&quot;&gt;Current Publishing Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an author you have a couple of options. You can try to pitch your idea to an established publisher. They would take care of the logistics, provide editing and help with the marketing and sales efforts. In return they would take a significant chunk of the profit. Normally you can expect a royalty between 15 and 50 percent per sale depending on the publisher. If you are a tough negotiator you can receive an advance. That will help to fund authoring and will be deduced from potential profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to self-publish. You will take care of the bits a traditional publisher would. In return you receive a larger chunk of the profit but on the downside you have more work ahead of you. Especially as a first time author this will include some additional risk as you have to learn these things. If you don&amp;apos;t have a pre-existing audience you will have to earn it. More established authors have an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-publishing-approaches&quot;&gt;Self-publishing Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose self-publishing you have some additional alternatives. You can do it the old fashioned way. First you find the potential reader somehow, demonstrate the value and close the sale. This isn&amp;apos;t the only way, though. Making the content freely available makes the sales effort voluntary. You can gain value, consider it zero and move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also try to compromise between these ends. Having some of the content available may encourage the potential reader to purchase the rest. You can also refine the content into different formats (audio/video) and aim to produce most of the income through that. A book can give you certain amount of prestige and lead to consulting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit of having the content freely available is that it becomes easy to share it. It won&amp;apos;t feel like selling. You can gently point towards your content without feeling too bad. Your readers can contribute directly without having to go through an errata process. Business-wise the problem is that you are relying on generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want something equivalent to an advance, there are a couple of alternatives. Platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/&quot;&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; have become popular. Essentially they provide one way to receive pre-sales and validate the concept. Platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; allow you to receive donations that can contribute towards your efforts. Feasibility of these depends upon your legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure potential interest before moving on with your idea you can set up a light landing page. There are services such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.launchrock.com/&quot;&gt;Launchrock&lt;/a&gt; that will allow you to set up one easily. You can start gathering emails of the interested readers and begin to build your audience. I went the hard way and build a site of my own but that doesn&amp;apos;t mean you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-alternative-self-publishing-approach&quot;&gt;An Alternative Self-publishing Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given it is not possible for me to leverage donations or crowdfunding without potential trouble I started thinking about alternatives. It seems to me it should be possible to merge some of the best features of both open and closed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how open approach fosters contribution. It is encouraging and helps you to refine your content better faster. The problem is that it is difficult to demonstrate value and convert that into sales. The closed approach doesn&amp;apos;t have that problem but contributing won&amp;apos;t be as easy. In addition linking to content isn&amp;apos;t going to work by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it was possible to take a bit of open, a bit of closed and a bit of Kickstarter, mix it together and end up with something that works for both authors and readers? I imagine it could work as a graduation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A book idea is identified based on community demand. You as an author pick it up, perform further market study on it and decide to proceed based on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book will get started in a closed incubator (private GitHub repository for instance) and pre-sales begin. Early adopters will receive access to the content and will be able to contribute towards development of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a predefined sales threshold is reached (Kickstarter bit) the book content will become available to the public. To make sure book content becomes open despite the sales, a time limit (a year or two?) can be set after which it will become open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that by starting closed you provide incentive for early adopters to buy due to exclusivity. Just being able to contribute towards the development of the book can be a good incentive. You will still get contributions just like in an open model. This requires a certain level of trust, however. What if someone forks the content and runs with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter bit is there to push community towards a common goal. Open content is valuable as it will allow people to access knowledge regardless of their income. It is a shame to see old books become forgotten due to long copyright terms. The time limit is a way to work against this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often good technical books become obsolete in a blink. Having them maintained by the community that uses them actively seems like a good idea to me. After all this is the way open source has proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps hitting some kind of a balance between open and closed ways of publishing would pave way for more technical authors. In addition it should help in keeping the content fresh. That is a problem that plagues technical books in particular. Technology tends to be a moving target and having books with better longevity isn&amp;apos;t a bad goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe an alternative model such as this could help to alleviate some of the risks involved. I am certain there are problems I am overlooking. But based on what I&amp;apos;ve seen perhaps it could work. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

It was an attempt to change the direction of my career. Being a subcontractor&amp;apos;s subcontractor provides income, sure, but was a dead end for me with no room to grow in an economy that keeps getting tougher. Interestingly the book has garnered a lot of attention and I believe some have found it useful. It has been bit of a disaster economically and it&amp;apos;s hard to imagine I could keep a business like this up for long if something doesn&amp;apos;t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-survivejs-webpack-and-react-was-written-&quot;&gt;Why SurviveJS - Webpack and React Was Written?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first steps towards the book were taken at the end of January. I happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html&quot;&gt;a blog post about Webpack by Christian Alfoni&lt;/a&gt;. As I had worked with webpack and React earlier I of course couldn&amp;apos;t resist commenting. I even proposed that it would be nice if there was a cookbook about the topic. The comment has been lost to the history but Christian took on my initiative. As a result &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/&quot;&gt;react-webpack-cookbook&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked on it together for a few weeks and I started to realize there&amp;apos;s demand. It would have saved me so much time if someone had gathered this information to one place. As a result I poked a contact of mine at a quite known book publisher that pays decent royalties. And so the negotiations began. We negotiated till early April but in the end the publisher wasn&amp;apos;t interested. We failed at writing style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could have been the end of the story but the opportunity seemed too good to miss. There was a clear demand for a book. Why not to write it? As Christian got busy with work and I was getting increasingly frustrated with my situation I decided to channel the frustration towards something constructive and so I started writing the book. Sometimes you have to go &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot; no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn&amp;apos;t feel like going through another round of negotiations with other publishers and I was aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; I decided to pick them. Early on I agreed with Christian to keep the material open. I was a bit hesitant at first but the approach has shown some of its benefits. I&amp;apos;m still a bit unsure about the financial part, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about Leanpub is that it allows you to test the market so to speak. I actually released the initial, raw version of the book for free and slowly but surely started to bump up the price as the content matured. That allowed me to gauge interest in the topic. One day Leanpub decided to feature the book and this in turn converted to a nice amount of sales. It always gives you an extra dose of motivation to see people actually appreciate your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative would have been to start pre-sales through a platform such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately that was not an option for me as a finn given our legislation is against it. There are strict regulations against donations to protect citizens against fraud. Even though understandable it can be a little restricting at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-i-failed-&quot;&gt;Where I Failed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the content &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react&quot;&gt;out in the open&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in numerous external contributions. I believe this has contributed towards the quality of the book immensely and will continue to do so. But here lies the great conundrum. Why would you pay for something that&amp;apos;s freely available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the book has earned around $1177 excluding Leanpub&amp;apos;s cut (10% + $0.50 per sale). After all the middlemen (PayPal, government, co-op) get their cut and taxes have been paid, that translates to 614 euros. That would be even less if I earned more per year due to the way tax progression works. It would have been more profitable for me to fiddle my thumbs at home and live on social security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is can this situation be changed somehow? I would of course love to keep on developing content. The goofy prefix &lt;code&gt;SurviveJS&lt;/code&gt; implies a series of book. But if I can expect profits like this it just doesn&amp;apos;t make any sense economically. Even though I write because I want to write I still need to make enough to have butter on my bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial plan was that people that feel they get value out of the book would buy the digital version to help fund the maintenance effort and development of new content. Unfortunately this isn&amp;apos;t working out as you can see from the figures above. Sure, the book might generate some income but nowhere enough to make this worth it financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see there are a few options. The easiest option would be just to give up and move onto something more profitable. I had a good run but it wasn&amp;apos;t enough this time. End of story. That would be a silly way to end this, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As donations are illegal that rules out Kickstarter, Patreon and such. I can see these approach have worked for many but unfortunately it&amp;apos;s not possible here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could stop maintaining the open content while putting all the effort to a superior, commercial version. I feel this might result in a lot of bad karma, though. That said I could develop commercial content on top of the free content and sell that perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the book has been a success in some ways and exposed people to webpack and React, unfortunately it has failed in the only way that matters in the end. If there&amp;apos;s not a sustainable source of income it is hard to justify the effort financially. I would love to develop more content but if the invisible hand decides it&amp;apos;s not possible, then it&amp;apos;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end if we want to keep this project alive we&amp;apos;ll need to climb that final, financial hurdle. It is the hardest hurdle for me as I may have to bend on some of my principles. How is it possible to combine open content and business?&lt;/p&gt;

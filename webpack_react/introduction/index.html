In this book we&apos;ll discuss  <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.

<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-webpack-" id="what-is-webpack-"></a><h2>What Is Webpack?<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-is-webpack-">#</a></h2>
<p>Webpack solves the fundamental problem of web development, namely module bundling. Webpack collects and processes a variety of web assets and packs them into a bundle that you can serve to your client. Even though this sounds simple, it is in fact a difficult problem that becomes more complex as your web application grows.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s say you have a form with a date input. Then you want to use jQuery plugins for a date picker and validation but you only want to include those plugins on specific pages. Webpack manages this module bundling scenario through configuration. This makes Webpack daunting to approach, yet powerful to use. This book helps you to get through that initial learning curve.</p>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-react-" id="what-is-react-"></a><h2>What Is React?<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-is-react-">#</a></h2>
<p>Facebook&apos;s React, a JavaScript library, is a component based view abstraction. A component could be a form input, button, or any other element in your user interface. This provides an interesting contrast to earlier approaches as React isn&apos;t bound to the DOM by design. You can use it to implement mobile applications for example.</p>
<p>Given React focuses only on the view you&apos;ll likely have to complement it with other libraries to give you the missing bits. This provides an interesting contrast to framework based approaches as they give you a lot more out of the box.</p>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-this-book-organized-" id="how-is-this-book-organized-"></a><h2>How Is This Book Organized?<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#how-is-this-book-organized-">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea of the book is to guide you through a small example project. After that we discuss more theoretical aspects of web development. The project in question will be a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> application.</p>
<p>We will start by building a Webpack based configuration. After that we will develop a small clone of a famous <a href="http://todomvc.com/">Todo application</a>. We will generalize from there and put in place <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux architecture</a> within our application. We will apply some <a href="https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/">Drag and Drop (DnD) magic</a> and start dragging things around. Finally we will get a production grade build done.</p>
<p>The theoretical parts of the book focus more on the tooling. Through those you will learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lint your code effectively using <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> and some other tools</li>
<li>author libraries at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a></li>
<li>style React in various emerging ways</li>
</ul>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-kanban-" id="what-is-kanban-"></a><h2>What is Kanban?<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-is-kanban-">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/kanban_intro.jpg" alt="Kanban by Dennis Hamilton (CC BY)"></p>
<p>Kanban, originally developed at Toyota, allows you to track the status of tasks. It can be modeled as <code>Lanes</code> and <code>Notes</code>. <code>Notes</code> move through <code>Lanes</code> representing stages from left to right as they become completed. <code>Notes</code> themselves can contain information about the task itself, its priority, and so on.</p>
<p>The simplest way to build a Kanban is to get a bunch of Post-it notes and find a wall. After that you split it up into columns. These <code>Lanes</code> could consist of the following stages: Todo, Doing, Done. All <code>Notes</code> would go to Todo initially. As you begin working on them, you would move them to Doing, and finally to Done when completed. This is the simplest way to get started.</p>
<p>As the system gets more sophisticated you can start applying concepts such as a limit on Work In Progress (WIP). The effect of this is that you are forced to focus on getting that particular task done. That is one of the good consequences of using Kanban. Moving those notes around is satisfying. As a bonus you get visibility and know what is yet to be done.</p>
<p>A good example of Kanban in action on the web is <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. Sprintly has open sourced their <a href="https://github.com/sprintly/sprintly-kanban">React implementation of Kanban</a>. Ours won&apos;t be as sophisticated, but it will be enough to get started.</p>

<p>I expect that you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js. You should be able to use npm. If you know something about Webpack or React, that&apos;s great. By reading this book you will deepen your understanding of these tools.</p>

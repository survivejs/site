## SurviveJS - Training

What if instead of [reading the webpack book](/webpack/) or [the React book](/react/) you could go through the material and key ideas in a live environment with me? I have used the tool for a few years and I am a part of webpack core team. I wrote [a 499 page book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9526868803) about the tool and [spent a month touring Europe](/blog/euro-tour-2017/).

I've split the training offering into two different products:

* [Workshop](/workshop/) - Workshops can take anything from half a day to multiple days.
* [Clinic](/clinic/) - Clinics are short sessions (2-3 hours) that are meant to give you a quick overview of the topic while also helping you with particular problems you might have to solve. It's a good starting point before arranging a full workshop.

I'm based on Finland and expect accommodation to be compensated separately. The end of July (24-30.7) and August are exceptions as I'll run a series of clinics in Vienna, Austria then.

> 20% of webpack training income goes to Tobias Koppers, the main developer of webpack. I do this to support the project and enable its future growth.

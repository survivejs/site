As an author I like to keep an eye on the market. You have to know who you are against after all! It's not an understatement to say could that it's about to get swarmed with books. In this post I'll go through the ones I could find and provide you some intel on them. Perhaps you would like to get a couple of books to your collection!

## Free Books

Even though there are [a lot of freely available React resources](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) there aren't too many free books yet.

### SurviveJS - Webpack and React

[SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/) is the most comprehensive freely available book I'm aware of. It will show you how to set up a [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) based development environment and then develop a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) based on it. More theoretical topics, such as linting, styling and library authoring are discussed as well. At the time of writing it has 150 pages and more content is planned based on demand.

The book is open to external contributions and in fact a lot of people have contributed feedback and fixes. From author's point of view this has been just awesome!

If you like the book and want to support the effort, [buying a copy](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react) would most likely make the author's day. Suggested price without VAT is $20 though minimum of $15 is possible. Pay based on value you perceive as Leanpub books allow.

### React Webpack Cookbook

[React Webpack Cookbook](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/) is a little guide I developed with [Christian Alfoni](http://www.christianalfoni.com/). The eventual plan is to polish the content and host the improved version here with a similar support model.

## Commercial Books

The commercial side of React books is about to go wild. **Developing a React Edge** was likely the first book on the market. Since then a few others have followed. The challenge for authors is that as React moves forward quite fast. Books will require constant maintenance effort to stay up to date.

### Developing a React Edge: The JavaScript Library for User Interfaces

[Developing a React Edge](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902122.do) by Frankie Bagnardi, Jonathan Beebe, Richard Feldman, Tom Hallett, Simon Højberg and Karl Mikkelsen was published by Bleeding Edge Press at November 2014. At 234 pages it covers a wide range of React related issues starting from the very basics and including aspects such performance tuning, server side rendering and testing.

As I haven't bought the book it is hard for me to evaluate how up to date it is. The book has both digital and paperback versions available. At Amazon the price is around $30 for both VAT included. At O'Reilly digital edition costs $22.99.

### React+d3.js

[React+d3.js](http://swizec.com/reactd3js/) by [Swizec Teller](http://swizec.com/) is a focused book at 63 pages. At [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/reactd3js) it's minimum price is $9 while suggested on is at $19 VAT excluded. There are expanded packages available that provide more material such as screencast and example code. In the book you will build a small data visualization project based on the technologies.

If you want a quick read that's straight to the point, this could be it. It's nowhere broad as **Developing a React Edge** for instance but if you just want to visualize data, this might work.

### Rails Meets React.js

[Rails Meets React.js](http://blog.arkency.com/rails-react/) by Marcin Grzywaczewski and [Robert Pankowecki](http://robert.pankowecki.pl/) explains how to get started with React in Ruby on Rails environment. The book is available through Arkency for $49 and has over 150 pages.

Based on table of contents the book shows you how to get started from scratch, how to set up an effective asset pipeline and of course how to integrate with Rails. The book covers also concepts such as testing, forms and i18n.

### Easy React

[Easy React](http://easyreactbook.com/) by [W. Jason Gilmore](http://www.wjgilmore.com/) is available through [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/easyreact). The book is currently in beta and the price starts from $14.99 without VAT. At the time of writing it has 83 pages.

**Easy React** is a project based book and focuses on an application known as *VocabGiant*, a language learning tool. The book discusses a wide range of topics ranging from setting up a development environment, developing the app (Flux included), developing a backend (REST + Express + MongoDB) and React Native. So by the looks of it this should be a great book for a full stack developer!

### ReactJS Cookbook

[ReactJS Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/reactjs-cookbook) by Johannes Stein is available through Packt exclusively at the moment. It is on preorder for $12.40 and is due November.

As many books discussed by now, **ReactJS Cookbook** shows you how React components work and goes into topics such as animation, isomorphism, ES6 and testing. It is expected to have 301 pages so you could say cost per page ratio is very competitive here compared to other offerings.

### React.js Essentials

[React.js Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/reactjs-essentials) by [Artemij Fedosejev](http://artemij.com/) is available through Packt and Amazon. At Packt preorder price of the digital version is $12.40 while at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/React-js-Essentials-Artemij-Fedosejev-ebook/dp/B00YSILZRW) Kindle version is available for $29.75. According to Packt site the book should been available in July but Amazon has expected date at January 2016.

The book is expected to have 194 pages. It covers basics of React and goes into architecture (Flux). There is also information about testing (Jest). No official table of contents is available as of yet.

### Introduction to React

[Introduction to React](https://www.apress.com/9781484212462) by [Cory Gackenheimer](http://cgack.blogspot.com) is available through Apress and Amazon. At Apress digital edition is available for $17.99 while print costs $24.99. At Amazon paperback costs $19.68. The book is expected to be available at September.

The planned length of the book is 170 pages and it will cover basics of React, Flux architecture and testing at least. There is also specific discussion about JSX.

### React: Up & Running: Building Web Applications

[React: Up & Running: Building Web Applications](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042266.do) by [Stoyan Stefanov](http://www.phpied.com/) is available through O'Reilly and Amazon. At O'Reilly digital early access version costs $33.99 while print goes for $39.99. At Amazon print is slightly cheaper at $37.99.

Early chapters of the book are already available and according to Amazon the full book should be completed by December. The book will have around 250 pages.

I probably don't need to repeat myself here. Expect to learn basics of React and then some.

### Master React

[Master React](http://ludovf.net/reactbook/) by Ludovico Fischer doesn't have a lot of information available yet. Digital version of the book is due Autumn and there is some early content at the site.

By the looks of the book will go through a wide range of React related concepts. These include development tools, third party libraries, JSX and server-side React as with so many other books.

## React Native Books

There's also an emerging category of React Native books and the first book has already been released and more are on their way.

### Beginning Mobile App Development with React Native

[Beginning Mobile App Development with React Native](http://beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native.com/) by [Manuel Kiessling](http://manuel.kiessling.net/) is likely the first book on the market. It is available through [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native) for $29.99 (no VAT) and has 82 pages guiding you into the topic.

### Learning React Native

[Learning React Native](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041511.do) by [Bonnie Eisenman](http://blog.bonnieeisenman.com/) is available through O'Reilly and Amazon. At O'Reilly digital early access version costs $33.99 while print goes for $39.99. At Amazon print is available for $32.59 and is expected to deliver at December. The book will be around 200 pages long.

## Conclusion

A lot of the React books have significant overlap. Their length ranges from very short (63 pages) up to quite long (301 pages). There's also wide variance in pricing as a result. The cheapest goes for $9 while the most expensive costs $49. There are both self-published options and books backed by a publisher. It is hard to comment on the quality of the books as I haven't read these.

The situation is very interesting. It's going to be difficult for a book to stand out content-wise. The biggest differentiating factor I can see is actually openness of the book. My book is a notable exception to the rule. It's going to be interesting to see if it makes any difference compared to the competition and publisher backed options.

Let me know if I missed some awesome book at the comments and I'll add it to the listing.

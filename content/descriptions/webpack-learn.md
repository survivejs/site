The book would not have been possible without constant feedback by the community around the book. It has been developed to contain solutions to most bundling related problems you might encounter. You can see the book as a complement to the [official documentation](https://webpack.js.org/) which I helped to create. By reading the book, you will develop [an extensive configuration](https://github.com/survivejs-demos/webpack-demo) you understand.

If you happen to know webpack well already, there is still something there for you. I took care to write summaries and a conclusion chapter that allows you to refresh your knowledge. The book chapters are short and discuss webpack from different angles while helping you to learn more about the tool and related techniques.

**SurviveJS - Webpack** is meant for beginner to intermediate users of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Webpack is a powerful bundler that can simplify the creation of complex web applications.

I designed this book to help you get up to speed with the tool. The book project started early 2015 from a small wiki effort and has since evolved into a complete guide to webpack.

During this process I have become a core developer of webpack while learning a lot about it. In this book I share what I have learned during these years with you.

Webpack, a module bundler, is a powerful tool that helps you to develop complex web applications. It enables techniques, such as **code splitting**. You could say it solves the fundamental problem of web development and it has allowed developers to reach new levels of productivity.

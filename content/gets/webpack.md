The easiest way to get started with the material is to check out [the free online edition](/webpack/foreword). If you like it, [purchase a digital copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack). The digital edition comes in three formats (epub/mobi/pdf) and makes you eligible for future updates. You also get a cheatsheet and posters (pdf) covering the core ideas of webpack and a QA with Tobias Koppers (PDF) where the author of the tool answers tough questions.

About a third of the income goes to Tobias Koppers, the author of webpack. This is my way of saying thanks and supporting his effort. Since I'm a webpack core developer as well, you help me to spend more time on the project too.

> There's a [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack) for support. You can [check out the project at GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-book) and [support webpack directly through Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/webpack).

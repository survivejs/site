## SurviveJS - Training

I offer training on top of the books. The topics include JavaScript maintenance, React, and webpack. The topics may also be combined based on the exact need.

The way training works is simple, you'll have me available at your premises for a day or two and I'll go through the material with you while we perform exercises to drill down the points. I may bring guest stars (remote/local) depending on the need. The training can be combined with consulting.

Consider the following examples of cases that went through:

- [Kapsch](http://www.kapsch.net/) wanted to refactor internal tooling for a project and understand how it works. I brought the needed people together and helped to facilitate this process. The project culminated in two days of on-site training.
- [eBay](https://www.ebay.de/) wanted internal training based on React and webpack. We arranged two days training on-site and later on worked a week together consulting a specific project with certain goals.
- [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) wanted a week of on-site consulting and training. We went through both React and webpack topics in series of presentations and worked together where feasible.
- The founder of [Quantifio](http://www.quantifio.no/) wanted to understand webpack configuration of their project better. We spent two hours together and went through the ideas in detail based on the client need.

These are just a few examples of the training and consulting cases I've done. I have used webpack for a few years and I am a part of webpack core team. I wrote [a 337 page book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P2C69PR) about the tool and spent months touring with the book in 2017.

I'm based in Rautalampi, Finland and I am available up to two weeks although I can be around just a day or two. A week is a good compromise and often it's a good idea to arrange a meetup to get most out of the time.
